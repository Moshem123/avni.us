    description: `<p>My passion for computers started when my mom signed me for an HTML course when I was 10   where I built an optical illusion website full of iframes, marquees and cool images 😁. I spent my free time learning about domains, registering for free hosting plans and creating forums, one of them had 1000 unique entrances a day!</p>
<p>Then, I wanted more and pursued a career path that started from the army service in a technological unit, the rest is listed below so I'll spare that.</p>
<p>I'm a highly motivated individual, self-educating ability, constantly learning and developing.
Punctual, reliable, organized, service oriented and excellent in human relations.
Very high technical skills, Jack of all trades.</p>
<p>🇺🇸 Born in USA 🇺🇸</p>
<p>🇮🇱 Living in Israel 🇮🇱</p>
<p>Main development/scripting languages: Python, JavaScript, Bash</p>`
